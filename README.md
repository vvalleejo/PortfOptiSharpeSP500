# PortfOptiSharpeSP500
This notebook is a personal project. It compares a list of stocks with the performance of the S&P 500 between 01-01-2022 and 01-01-2023 using the sharpe ratio through a linear regression. 
The results are represented in a pie chart with the weights of each stock in the porfolio represented and in a table. Both in order from higher to lower.
In the final cell it is calculated the expected return of the porfolio daily and annualized and the volatility too.
